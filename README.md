# David Runger : Blog

This is the code for a blog where I ([@davidrunger](https://github.com/davidrunger/)) will blog
about stuff related to web development and software in general.

The blog can be seen at [https://davidrunger.com/blog/](https://davidrunger.com/blog/).

## Credits

The blog is built with [Bridgetown](https://www.bridgetownrb.com/).

I borrowed the [website of Felipe Vogel](https://fpsvogel.com)
([GitHub](https://github.com/fpsvogel/blog-2021)) as a starting point, and then I deleted lots of
stuff that I didn't want/need.
