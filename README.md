# David Runger : Blog

This is a blog where I ([@davidrunger](https://github.com/davidrunger/)) will blog about stuff
related to web development (probably focusing on Ruby on Rails).

The blog is built with [Bridgetown](https://www.bridgetownrb.com/).

This blog is currently not hosted anywhere, but my tentative plan is to eventually host it at
[https://davidrunger.com/blog/](https://davidrunger.com/blog/).

I borrowed the [website of Felipe Vogel](https://fpsvogel.com)
([GitHub](https://github.com/fpsvogel/blog-2021)) as a starting point, and then I deleted lots of
stuff that I didn't want/need.
